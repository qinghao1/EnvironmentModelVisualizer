Call parse_and_evaluate("get_frames();"); to obtain an array containing infomation of the environment.

Each entry is a "table", which is an array of key-value pairs showing the relationship between variables
and values in the correspondign frame.

For example, frames = parse_and_evaluate("get_frames();"); frames[0] will return the table showing infomation
of the global frame.

And each "table" contains several special entries.

For any frame[i], frame[i][0] is a pair("__viz_index", x), x indicates the index of the corresponding frame.
In face, x=i for every tables.

For every frame exception the global frame(frame[0]), frame[i][1] is a pair("__viz_enclosing", y), y indicates
the index of its enclosing frame. For instance, frame[1][1] is pair("__viz_enclosing", 0) since it is enclosed by
frame with index 0(the global frame).

The second entry of the global frame(frame[0][1]), and the third entry of other tables, which is frame[i][2] is 
pair("local_functions",...) contains all the function defined locally. 

The remaining is the same as the previous version.

And there is a simple demo in demo.png.
