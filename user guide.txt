Here comes interpreter V1

Use parse_and_evaluate("...") to change the state of the environment.

Call parse_and_evaluate("get_frames();") to get the environment object.

The structure of the frame tree is like what I have explained. 
A pair: [an array(works as a table) containing the information of the
	 global frame,
	 a list of subtrees of the global frame]
The head of pair is a 2D array(array of pairs).

The first pair of the array is [local_functions, [array of function values]]
Here is an example of one function value: { index: 2, parameter: [x,y,z], body: "return x+y+z;" }
[array of function values] is an array consisting of that kind of objects¡ü

From the second pair to the last, the head is the variable name and the tail is the value. 
There are several types of values but all of them are tagged objects:
For example:
{ tag:"primitive", value: 23 } represents number 1
{ tag:"primitive", value: "cs1101s" } represents string "cs1101s"
{ tag:"primitive", value: true } represents boolean true
{ tag:"function", index: 2 } represents the function value with the index 2
{ tag:"empty_list", index: 1 } represents the empty list with index 1(two empty 
			       list with same index meaning they are the same one, 
			       otherwise they should be draw seperatly).
{ tag:"pair"...} I have not worked on this type, please do not use it now
{ tag:"object" ...} Since it is out of our scope now, again, ignore it :)

For any questions or bugs, just message me:)
